### Version 0.0.1 - September 12, 2023
- Initialization of the first version with a history of changes.
- A new parameter was introduced in the Board class, allowing a list containing the individual values ​​of each letter in a written word to be retrieved.
- There were changes in the names of two functions of the Board class, using "verify" to indicate that these functions check the existence of the word in the array.
- Incorporation of three additional functions:
  1. `wordCurrentPoints`: Returns a list with the individual values ​​of the letters in the last word written in the array.
  2. `writeVerticalWord`: Allows you to write the selected word vertically into the matrix (verification has not been done yet, which is planned in future updates). This function calculates the value of each box and multiplies the individual letters if they land on a double or triple letter box.
  3. `writeHorizontalWord`: Makes it possible to write the chosen word horizontally in the matrix (it has not yet been verified, which will be carried out in future updates). This function also calculates the value of each box and multiplies the individual letters if it is in a double or triple letter box.
